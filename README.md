# Flashcards
An app that lets you create and flip through flashcards.
## Motivation
1. Certain popular flashcards apps have now become unfortunately monetized (ahem... Izlet-quay).
2. This is an exercise in simple app construction.
## Project Structure
The structure of this project generally follows the recommendations from [python-guide.org](https://docs.python-guide.org/writing/structure/). However, it's also structured with the idea that [PyInstaller](https://pyinstaller.org/en/stable/) will be used to bundle the app and its dependencies into a single package.
## Dependencies
This shouldn't apply to anyone downloading the packaged app, but for the record:
 - Python 3.12 (downloaded from [here](https://www.python.org/downloads/))
 - PyQt 6.7.0 ([pip-installed](https://doc.qt.io/qtforpython-6/quickstart.html#quick-start))
 - [pytest](https://pypi.org/project/pytest/) 24.0
